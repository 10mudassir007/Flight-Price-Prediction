## Overview

This project uses historical flight data and statistical / machine learning methods to predict flight ticket prices. The prediction model is exposed via a REST API so that it can be used by frontends or other services.  

---

## Features

- Data pipeline for cleaning, feature engineering, model training.  
- Predictive model serialized (`.pkl`) for inference.  
- REST API endpoints to get price predictions.  
- Logging configuration for debugging / monitoring.  
- Structured layout, tests, and notebooks for experimentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- `pip` for installing dependencies  
- (Optional) virtual environment tool like `venv` or `conda`  
- (Optional) MLflow if you're using tracking  

### Setup and Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/10mudassir007/Flight-Price-Prediction.git
cd Flight-Price-Prediction

# Checkout structured branch (if not already)
git checkout structured

# Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### Running the API

```bash
uvicorn main:app
```
